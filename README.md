Port of AW by RiskyKen into MC 1.16

Go to the [homepage](https://jeondohyeon.github.io/Armourers-Workshop-1.16) for the latest update of this document.

# This is a fork
We found a critical difficulty on migrating AW onto 1.16, so created a blank one.

This one has non-code files from AW and FML 36.2.0 things.
