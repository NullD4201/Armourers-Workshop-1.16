## To contribute in JAVA, please do on Pre-Alpha
This is not for the publish, but just the root repo. Please contribute on [*Pre-Alpha* branch](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop-1.16/tree/Experiment(pre-Alpha)) as it's the actual root repo.

## To contribute in Kotlin, please do on [Experiment/KotlinTest](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop-1.16/tree/Experiment/KotlinTest)
Same as above. However, there's JAVA code lovers and Kotlin code lovers, so spliting the repo is the best way.

## To contribute in other languages, please create an issue
We'll manage to create the exact language you want.
