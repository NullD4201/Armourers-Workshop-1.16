# Contributing

You can contribute this project into several parts: `Code`, `Localizations`, and `Wiki`.

## Contribute into Code

You can contribute about the code with pull request.

**Every pull request will be recorded to Actions > Build, even which you've forked.**

Also, **the pull requests will be recorded to [project document](https://github.com/users/JeonDohyeon/projects/2)**,
as `To-Do`(Issues), `In-Progress`(Pull Requests), `Review In Progress`(Review Required), `Reviewer Approved`(Review Done: Approved), or `Done/Denied`(Merged/Denied).

*Tip: If you created an PR to `main`, the PR will be declined.*

### Contribute into Localizations

Yup, you can still contribute the localizations on this repo. The desc will be written in english(the base!!!), and you can localize it into your language.

**The localization document type is completely different from up to Forge 1.12.x**, so you should check it out once more.

Localizations are also the code changes, so **it will be recorded as pull requests** as if it's code contributions.

## Contribute into Wiki

You can write a wiki of AW, but it'll be approved when the API code is completed to be ported into 1.16.5.

You can write a tip of creating armours, how to publish it, how to use the model in other 3D-supported programs, etc.
