There'll not be so many branches: There'll be **Experiment**, **Dangerous**, **Preview**, and **Release**.
(`Experiment/Kotlin` and `test` are removed lately)
<br>
**Using other coding language is unavailable at this moment. If you want it, create your own fork. <br> Updates on those will not be merged into here.**

`main` will get updates when the latest successful build is successfully applied to server, with no conflicts.

## Build

When you're to build, you should use one of these:
- [**Dangerous(Alpha)**](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop-1.16#Dangerous(Alpha)) for the latest successful build
- [**Preview(Beta)**](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop-1.16#Preview(Beta)) for the latest working build
- [**main**](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop-1.16#main) for the latest release

When you're to build, firstly clone the repo you're to build.
<br>
And at where you're extracted the archive,
- run `chmod +x gradlew` and `./gradlew build`(or just `sudo gradlew build`) on Linux,
- or `.\gradlew.bat build` with admin console on Windows.
