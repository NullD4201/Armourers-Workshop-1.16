# Current Workflow

Currently we're working on updating the code into 1.16.5 Forge.

Since the Forge Mod Loader(a.k.a. `FML`)'s API code has greatly changed, we have to resolve the dependencies from old to new.
> In some parts, we should even **rewrite** the code since the old code is not supported after the migration.

Also, the native **Minecraft**'s code was changed alot too, but they're easier than FML because the internal code of API has not changed that much.
